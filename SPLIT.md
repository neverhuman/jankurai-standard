## Role

Standard, mission, public conformance policy, and agent-native guidance text.

## Repositories

- Local authoritative repo: `root/jankurai-standard`
- Public mirror: `neverhuman/jankurai-standard`
- Release tag pattern: `jankurai-standard-v1.7.0-split.0`
- Source extraction commit: `cea83b0cbe204be276a2f0299cd760f6812ea2b0`

## Split Rules

- Jeryu remains authoritative; GitHub is the public mirror.
- Release builds depend on immutable GitHub tags, not branches.
- Local development uses the hub `scripts/fuse.sh` output under `.fusion/`.
- Committed manifests must not depend on sibling checkout paths.
- Generated outputs are regenerated from their source contracts or build commands.

## Required Local Check

```bash
bash scripts/ci-local.sh required
```
